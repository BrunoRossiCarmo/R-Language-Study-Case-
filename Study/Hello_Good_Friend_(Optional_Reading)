Hello, good friend! My name's Bruno and I'm trying to study data analyses (mainly in R) to make easily my work on transcriptomics area. 
If you don't know what is that, Transcriptomic is an area of Bioinformatics that aims to analyze all the transcriptions of a biological organism.
So, I started to study R and I'll deposit all of my path and documents right here, for everyone!
